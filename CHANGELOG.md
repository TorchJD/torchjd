# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). This changelog does not include internal
changes that do not affect the user.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Changed `IMTLG` implementation to use `torch.linalg.lstsq` instead of
  `torch.linalg.pinv`. It should be faster and more numerically stable, but it could slightly modify
  the results of `IMTLG` (see https://github.com/TorchJD/torchjd/issues/132 for the discussion).

## [0.2.0] - 2024-09-05

### Added

- `autojac` package containing the backward pass functions and their dependencies.
- `mtl_backward` function to make a backward pass for multi-task learning.
- Multi-task learning example.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Moved the `backward` module to the `autojac` package. Some imports may have to be
  adapted.
- Improved documentation of `backward`.

### Fixed

- Fixed wrong tensor device with `IMTLG` in some rare cases.
- **BREAKING**: Removed the possibility of populating the `.grad` field of a tensor that does not
  expect it when calling `backward`. If an input `t` provided to backward does not satisfy
  `t.requires_grad and (t.is_leaf or t.retains_grad)`, an error is now raised.
- **BREAKING**: When using `backward`, aggregations are now accumulated into the `.grad` fields
  of the inputs rather than replacing those fields if they already existed. This is in line with the
  behavior of `torch.autograd.backward`.
