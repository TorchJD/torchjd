class UPGradWrapper(Weighting):
    """
    Wrapper of :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.bases.Weighting` that changes the weights vector such
    that each weighted row is projected onto the dual cone of all rows. If the wrapped weighting is
    :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.mean.Mean`, this corresponds exactly to UPGrad, as defined in our
    paper.

    :param weighting: The wrapped weighting.
    :param norm_eps: A small value to avoid division by zero when normalizing.
    :param reg_eps: A small value to add to the diagonal of the gramian of the matrix. Due to
        numerical errors when computing the gramian, it might not exactly be positive definite.
        This issue can make the optimization fail. Adding ``reg_eps`` to the diagonal of the gramian
        ensures that it is positive definite.
    :param solver: The solver used to optimize the underlying optimization problem. Defaults to
        ``'quadprog'``.

    .. admonition::
        Example

        Use UPGrad to aggregate a matrix.

        >>> from torch import tensor
        >>> from torchjd.aggregation import WeightedAggregator, UPGradWrapper, MeanWeighting
        >>>
        >>> W = UPGradWrapper(MeanWeighting())
        >>> A = WeightedAggregator(W)
        >>> J = tensor([[-4., 1., 1.], [6., 1., 1.]])
        >>>
        >>> A(J)
        tensor([0.2929, 1.9004, 1.9004])

        We can also call the weighting directly to get the weights vector associated to the matrix:

        >>> W(J)
        tensor([1.1109, 0.7894])
