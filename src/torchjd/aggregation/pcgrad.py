class PCGradWeighting(Weighting):
    """
    :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.bases.Weighting` that extracts weights using the PCGrad
    algorithm, as defined in algorithm 1 of `Gradient Surgery for Multi-Task Learning
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06782.pdf>`_.

    .. admonition::
        Example

        Use PCGrad to aggregate a matrix.

        >>> from torch import tensor
        >>> from torchjd.aggregation import WeightedAggregator, PCGradWeighting
        >>>
        >>> W = PCGradWeighting()
        >>> A = WeightedAggregator(W)
        >>> J = tensor([[-4., 1., 1.], [6., 1., 1.]])
        >>>
        >>> A(J)
        tensor([0.5848, 3.8012, 3.8012])

        We can also call the weighting directly to get the weights vector associated to the matrix:

        >>> W(J)
        tensor([2.2222, 1.5789])

    .. note::
        This implementation corresponds to the paper's algorithm, which differs from the `official
        implementation <https://github.com/tianheyu927/PCGrad>`_ in the way randomness is handled.
