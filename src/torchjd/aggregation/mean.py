    :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.bases.Weighting` that gives the weights

        Example

        Average the rows of a matrix

        >>> from torch import tensor
        >>> from torchjd.aggregation import WeightedAggregator, MeanWeighting
        >>>
        >>> W = MeanWeighting()
        >>> A = WeightedAggregator(W)
        >>> J = tensor([[-4., 1., 1.], [6., 1., 1.]])
        >>>
        >>> A(J)
        tensor([1., 1., 1.])

        We can also call the weighting directly to get the weights vector associated to the matrix:

        >>> W(J)
        tensor([0.5000, 0.5000])
