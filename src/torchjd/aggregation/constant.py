        Example

        Compute a linear combination of the rows of a matrix.

        >>> from torch import tensor
        >>> from torchjd.aggregation import WeightedAggregator, ConstantWeighting
        >>>
        >>> W = ConstantWeighting(tensor([1., 2.]))

        >>>
        >>> A(J)

        We can also call the weighting directly to get the weights vector associated to the matrix:

        >>> W(J)
