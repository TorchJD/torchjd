# Gradients: A TensorDict in which the shape of each value must be the same as the shape of its
#   corresponding key.
# Jacobians: A TensorDict in which the values must all have the same first dimension and the rest of
#   the shape of each value must be the same as the shape of its corresponding key.
# GradientVectors: A TensorDict containing flattened gradients: the values must be vectors with the
#   same number of elements as their corresponding key.
# JacobianMatrices: A TensorDict containing matrixified (flattened into matrix shape) jacobians: the
#   values must be matrices with a unique first dimension and with a second dimension equal to the
#   number of elements of their corresponding key.
