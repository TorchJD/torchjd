    """
    In the context of Multi-Task Learning (MTL), we often have a shared feature extractor followed
    by several task-specific heads. A loss can then be computed for each task.

    This function computes the gradient of each task-specific loss with respect to its task-specific
    parameters and accumulates it in their ``.grad`` fields. Then, it computes the Jacobian of all
    losses with respect to the shared parameters, aggregates it and accumulates the result in their
    ``.grad`` fields.

    :param losses: The task losses. The Jacobian matrix will have one row per loss.
    :param features: The last shared representation used for all tasks, as given by the feature
        extractor. Should be non-empty.
    :param aggregator: Aggregator used to reduce the Jacobian into a vector.
    :param tasks_params: The parameters of each task-specific head. Their ``requires_grad`` flags
        must be set to ``True``. If not provided, the parameters considered for each task will
        default to the leaf tensors that are in the computation graph of its loss, but that were not
        used to compute the ``features``.
    :param shared_params: The parameters of the shared feature extractor. The Jacobian matrix will
        have one column for each value in these tensors. Their ``requires_grad`` flags must be set
        to ``True``. If not provided, defaults to the leaf tensors that are in the computation graph
        of the ``features``.
    :param retain_graph: If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad will be freed. Defaults to
        ``False``.
    :param parallel_chunk_size: The number of scalars to differentiate simultaneously in the
        backward pass. If set to ``None``, all coordinates of ``tensors`` will be differentiated in
        parallel at once. If set to ``1``, all coordinates will be differentiated sequentially. A
        larger value results in faster differentiation, but also higher memory usage. Defaults to
        ``None``. If ``parallel_chunk_size`` is not large enough to differentiate all tensors
        simultaneously, ``retain_graph`` has to be set to ``True``.

    .. admonition::
        Example

        A usage example of ``mtl_backward`` is provided in
        :doc:`Multi-Task Learning (MTL) <../../examples/mtl>`.

    .. note::
        ``shared_params`` should contain no parameter in common with ``tasks_params``. The different
        tasks may have some parameters in common. In this case, the sum of the gradients with
        respect to those parameters will be accumulated into their ``.grad`` fields.

    .. warning::
        ``mtl_backward`` relies on a usage of ``torch.vmap`` that is not compatible with compiled
        functions. The arguments of ``mtl_backward`` should thus not come from a compiled model.
        Check https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/138422 for the status of this issue.

    .. warning::
        Because of a limitation of ``torch.vmap``, tensors in the computation graph of the
        ``features`` parameter should not have their ``retains_grad`` parameter set to ``True``.
