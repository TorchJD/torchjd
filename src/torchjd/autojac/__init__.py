"""
This package enables Jacobian descent, through the ``backward`` and ``mtl_backward`` functions, which
are meant to replace the call to ``torch.backward`` or ``loss.backward`` in gradient descent. To
combine the information of the Jacobian, an aggregator from the ``aggregation`` package has to be
used.
