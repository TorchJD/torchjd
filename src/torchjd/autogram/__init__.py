The autogram package provides an engine to efficiently compute the Gramian of the Jacobian of a
tensor of outputs (generally losses) with respect to some modules' parameters. This Gramian contains
all the inner products between pairs of gradients, and is thus a sufficient statistic for most
weighting methods. The algorithm is formally defined in Section 6 of `Jacobian Descent For
Multi-Objective Optimization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16232>`_).

Due to computing the Gramian iteratively over the layers, without ever having to store the full
Jacobian in memory, this method is much more memory-efficient than
:doc:`autojac <../autojac/index>`, which makes it often much faster.

The list of Weightings compatible with ``autogram`` is:

* :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.UPGradWeighting`
* :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.AlignedMTLWeighting`
* :class:`~torchjd.aggregation.CAGradWeighting`
