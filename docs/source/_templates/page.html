<!--
Adds a canonical link to the stable version of the documentation to each built hmtl page.
The reason to do that is that search engines require it:
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls

This template overrides the page.html furo template
(https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/blob/main/src/furo/theme/furo/page.html) by adding an extra line
to its <head> section, with the appropriate canonical link. Note that there is no guarantee that the
furo theme keeps using a file named page.html, so this could silently break with future updates of
furo. See https://pradyunsg.me/furo/customisation/injecting/ and
https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/discussions/248 for more information.
