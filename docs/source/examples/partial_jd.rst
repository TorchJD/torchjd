Partial Jacobian Descent for IWRM
=================================

This example demonstrates how to perform Partial Jacobian Descent using TorchJD. This technique
minimizes a vector of per-instance losses by resolving conflict only based on a submatrix of the
Jacobian â€” specifically, the portion corresponding to a selected subset of the model's parameters.
This approach offers a trade-off between the precision of the aggregation decision and the
computational cost associated with computing the Gramian of the full Jacobian. For a complete,
non-partial version, see the :doc:`IWRM <iwrm>` example.

In this example, our model consists of three ``Linear`` layers separated by ``ReLU`` layers. We
perform the partial descent by considering only the parameters of the last two ``Linear`` layers. By
doing this, we avoid computing the Jacobian and its Gramian with respect to the parameters of the
first ``Linear`` layer, thereby reducing memory usage and computation time.
