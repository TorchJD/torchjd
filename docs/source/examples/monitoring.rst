Monitoring aggregations
=======================

The :doc:`Aggregator <../docs/aggregation/index>` class is a subclass of :class:`torch.nn.Module`.
This allows registering hooks, which can be used to monitor some information about aggregations.
The following code example demonstrates registering a hook to compute and print the cosine
similarity between the aggregation performed by :doc:`UPGrad <../docs/aggregation/upgrad>` and the
average of the gradients, and another hook to compute and print the weights of the weighting of
:doc:`UPGrad <../docs/aggregation/upgrad>`.

Updating the parameters of the model with the average gradient is equivalent to using gradient
descent on the average of the losses. Observing a cosine similarity smaller than 1 means that
Jacobian descent is doing something different than gradient descent. With
:doc:`UPGrad <../docs/aggregation/upgrad>`, this happens when the original gradients conflict (i.e.
they have a negative inner product).
