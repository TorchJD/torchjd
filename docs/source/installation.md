```

Note that `torchjd` requires Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 and `torch>=2.0`.

Some aggregators (CAGrad and Nash-MTL) have additional dependencies that are not included by default
when installing `torchjd`. To install them, you can use:
```
pip install torchjd[cagrad]
```
```
pip install torchjd[nash_mtl]
```

To install `torchjd` with all of its optional dependencies, you can also use:
```
pip install torchjd[full]
```
