    there exists no vector 0 < w with w^T A = 0.

    Obtaining such a matrix is done by sampling two unit-norm vectors v, v', whose sum u is a
    positive vector. These two vectors are also non-negative and non-zero, and are furthermore
    orthogonal. Then, a matrix A, orthogonal to v, is sampled. By its orthogonality to v, A is
    weakly stationary. Moreover, since v' is a non-negative left-singular vector of A with positive
    singular value s, any 0 < w satisfies w^T A != 0. Otherwise, we would have
    0 = w^T A A^T v' = s w^T v' > 0, which is a contradiction. A is thus also not strongly
