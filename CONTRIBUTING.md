# Contributing to TorchJD

This document explains how to contribute to TorchJD.

## Getting Started

- **Minor changes** (bug fixes, documentation, small improvements): Open a pull request directly following the guidelines in this document.
- **Significant or major changes** (new features, API changes, architectural decisions): Join the [SimplexLab Discord server](https://discord.gg/76KkRnb3nk), introduce yourself and your idea, and discuss it with the community to determine if and how it fits within the project's goals before implementing.

## Code Ownership

This project uses a [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file to automatically assign reviewers to pull requests
based on which files are changed. The code owners are the people or groups who created or maintain
specific parts of the codebase.

When you open a pull request, GitHub will automatically request reviews from the relevant code owners
for the files you've modified. This ensures that changes are reviewed by the people most familiar
with the affected code.

## Installation

To work with TorchJD, we suggest you to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). While this is not
mandatory, we only provide installation steps with this tool. You can install it by following their
[installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). We also
suggest to use VSCode with the `Python`, `ty` and `ruff` extensions (without `Pylance`).

1) Pre-requisites: Use `uv` to install a Python version compatible with TorchJD and to pin it to the
  `TorchJD` folder. From the root of the `TorchJD` repo, run:
   ```bash
   uv python install 3.14.0
   uv python pin 3.14.0
   ```

2) Create a virtual environment and install the project in it. From the root of `TorchJD`, run:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   CC=gcc uv pip install --python-version=3.14 -e '.[full]' --group check --group doc --group test --group plot
   ```
   If you want to install PyTorch with a different CUDA version (this could be required depending on
   your GPU), you'll need to specify an extra index. For instance, for CUDA 12.6, run:
      ```bash
   uv venv
   CC=gcc uv pip install --python-version=3.14 -e '.[full]' --group check --group doc --group test --group plot --index-strategy unsafe-best-match --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
   ```

3) Set environment variables:

   We need to use `UV_NO_SYNC=1` to prevent `uv` from syncing all the time. This is because by
   default, it tries to resolve libraries compatible with the whole range of Python versions
   supported by TorchJD, but in reality, we just need an installation compatible with the currently
   used Python version. That's also why we specify `--python-version=3.14` when running
   `uv pip install`. To follow that recommendation, add the following line to your `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   export UV_NO_SYNC=1
   ```
   and start a new terminal. The alternative is to use the `--no-sync` flag whenever you run a pip
   command that would normally sync (like `uv run`).

   Lastly, to run some scripts from the `tests` folder, you'll have to add the `TorchJD/tests`
   folder to your `PYTHONPATH`. For that, you should add the following line to your `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_TorchJD>/tests"
   ```
   where `<path_to_TorchJD>` is the absolute path to your `TorchJD` repo.

4) Install pre-commit:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

> [!TIP]
> If you're running into issues when `uv` tries to compile `ecos`, make sure that `gcc` is
> installed. Alternatively, you can try to install `clang` or try to use some older Python version
> (3.12) for which `ecos` has provided compiled packages (the list is accessible
> [here](https://pypi.org/project/ecos/#files)).

> [!TIP]
> The Python version that you should specify in your IDE is `<path-to-TorchJD>/.venv/bin/python`.

> [!TIP]
> In the following commands, you can get rid of the `uv run` prefix if you activate the `venv`
> created by `uv`, using `source .venv/bin/activate` from the root of `TorchJD`. This will, however,
> only work in the current terminal until it is closed.


### Clean reinstallation

If you want to update all dependencies or just reinstall from scratch, run the following command
from the root of `TorchJD`:
```bash
rm -rf .venv
rm -f uv.lock
uv venv
CC=gcc uv pip install --python-version=3.14 -e '.[full]' --group check --group doc --group test --group plot
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Working with agents

We encourage contributors to use AI agents when contributing to TorchJD, but there are a few rules:
- The initiative should come from a human. We do not want PRs from fully automated bots.
- The changes should be reviewed by a human before a non-draft PR is open.
- To avoid vendor lock-in, we do not provide any file that is specific to an agent vendor. To use a specific agent that does not follow open file naming conventions, you have to adapt a few things yourself (e.g. symlink files). For example, to work with claude, you have to symlink `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/skill/` to `skills/`.

## Checks

### Running tests
   - To verify that your installation was successful, and that unit tests pass, run:
     ```bash
     uv run pytest tests/unit
     ```

   - To also run the unit tests that are marked as slow, add the `--runslow` flag:
     ```bash
     uv run pytest tests/unit --runslow
     ```

   - If you have access to a cuda-enabled GPU, you should also check that the unit tests pass on it:
     ```bash
     PYTEST_TORCH_DEVICE=cuda:0 uv run pytest tests/unit
     ```

   - To check that the usage examples from docstrings and `.rst` files are correct, run:
     ```bash
     uv run make doctest -C docs
     ```

  - To compute the code coverage locally, you should run the unit tests with the `--cov` flag:
    ```bash
    uv run pytest tests/unit --cov=src
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > The code coverage value reported locally is lower than the value that our CI obtains, because
    > the CI runs the tests in several different environments.

### Building the documentation locally
   - Run:
     ```bash
     uv run make clean -C docs
     uv run make html -C docs
     ```
   - You can then open `docs/build/html/index.html` with a web browser.

### Type checking

We use [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) for type-checking. If you're on VSCode, we recommend using
the `ty` extension. You can also run it from the root of the repo with:
```bash
uv run ty check
```

## Development guidelines

The following guidelines should help preserve a good code quality in TorchJD. Contributions that do
not respect these guidelines will still be greatly appreciated but will require more work from
maintainers to be merged.

### Documentation

Most source Python files in TorchJD have a corresponding `.rst` in `docs/source`. Please make sure
to add such a documentation entry whenever you add a new public module. In most cases, public
classes should contain a usage example in their docstring. We also ask contributors to add an entry
in the `[Unreleased]` section of the changelog whenever they make a change that may affect users (we
do not report internal changes). If this section does not exist yet (right after a release), you
should create it.

### Testing

We ask contributors to implement the unit tests necessary to check the correctness of their
implementations. We aim for 100% code coverage, but we greatly appreciate any PR, even with
insufficient code coverage. To ensure that the tensors generated during the tests are on the right
device and dtype, you have to use the partial functions defined in `tests/utils/tensors.py` to
instantiate tensors. For instance, instead of
```python
import torch

a = torch.ones(3, 4)
```
use
```python
from utils.tensors import ones_

a = ones_(3, 4)
```

This will automatically call `torch.ones` with `device=DEVICE`. This way, your test will
automatically be run on cuda when running it with the `PYTEST_TORCH_DEVICE=cuda:0` environment
variable, and will automatically be run on `float64` with `PYTEST_TORCH_DTYPE=float64`.
If the function you need does not exist yet as a partial function in `tensors.py`, add it.
Lastly, when you create a model or a random generator, you have to move them manually to the right
device (the `DEVICE` defined in `settings.py`).
```python
import torch
from torch.nn import Linear
from settings import DEVICE

model = Linear(3, 4).to(device=DEVICE)
rng = torch.Generator(device=DEVICE)
```
You may also use a `ModuleFactory` to make the modules on `DEVICE` automatically.

### Coding style

We try to keep the quality of the codebase as high as possible. Even if this slows down development
in the short term, it helps a lot in the long term. To make the code easy to understand and to
maintain, we try to keep it simple, and to stick as much as possible to the
[SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID). Try to preserve the existing coding style
of the library when adding new sources. Also, please make sure that new modules are imported by the
`__init__.py` file of the package they are located into. This makes them easier to import for the
user.

### Adding a new aggregator

Mathematically, an aggregator is a mapping $\mathcal A: \mathbb R^{m \times n} \to \mathbb R^n$. In
the context of Jacobian descent, it is used to reduce a Jacobian matrix into a vector that can be
used to update the parameters. In TorchJD, an `Aggregator` subclass should be a faithful
implementation of a mathematical aggregator.

> [!NOTE]
> We also accept stateful aggregators, whose output depends both on the Jacobian and on some
> internal state (which can be affected for example by previous Jacobians). Such aggregators should
> inherit from the `Stateful` mixin and implement a `reset` method.

> [!NOTE]
> Some aggregators may depend on something else than the Jacobian. To implement them, please add
> setters so that any extra information can be given by the user to the aggregator before it is
> actually used. For example, if your aggregator needs to take the loss values, this can be given
> at every iteration through a `set_losses` setter.

> [!NOTE]
> Before working on the implementation of a new aggregator, please contact us via an issue or a
> discussion: in many cases, we have already thought about it, or even started an implementation.

### Deprecation

To deprecate some public functionality, make it raise a `DeprecationWarning`. A test should also be
added in `tests/unit/test_deprecations.py`, ensuring that this warning is issued.

## Trajectories

The `tests/trajectories/` directory contains scripts to generate and visualize optimization
trajectories using various aggregators on simple multi-objective problems. They require the `plot`
dependency group.

Available objective keys: `EWQ`, `CQF`, `HQF`.

Available aggregator keys: `upgrad`, `mgda`, `cagrad`, `nashmtl`, `graddrop`,
`imtl_g`, `aligned_mtl`, `dualproj`, `pcgrad`, `random`, `mean`.

**Step 1 — Optimize:** run the optimization for an objective and a selection of aggregators:
```bash
uv run python tests/trajectories/optimize.py EWQ upgrad mean mgda cagrad dualproj graddrop imtl_g aligned_mtl nashmtl random
```
This saves trajectory data under `tests/trajectories/results/` (gitignored).

**Step 2 — Plot:** generate the plots from the saved trajectories:
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=Agg
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_params.py EWQ
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_values.py EWQ
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_distance_to_pf.py EWQ
```

To run everything:
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=Agg
uv run python tests/trajectories/optimize.py EWQ upgrad mean mgda cagrad dualproj graddrop imtl_g aligned_mtl nashmtl random
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_params.py EWQ
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_values.py EWQ
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_distance_to_pf.py EWQ
uv run python tests/trajectories/optimize.py CQF upgrad mean mgda cagrad dualproj graddrop imtl_g aligned_mtl nashmtl random
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_params.py CQF
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_values.py CQF
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_distance_to_pf.py CQF
uv run python tests/trajectories/optimize.py HQF upgrad mean mgda cagrad dualproj graddrop imtl_g aligned_mtl nashmtl random
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_params.py HQF
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_values.py HQF
uv run python tests/trajectories/plot_distance_to_pf.py HQF
```

The three plot scripts produce PDFs saved to `tests/trajectories/results/<objective>/`.

> [!NOTE]
> The plot scripts require a LaTeX installation for rendering:
> `sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended dvipng cm-super`
